# That's so gay!

'That's so gay' is a simple, easy-to-use, non-profit platform with aim to collect everyday microaggressions towards lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans, intersex and queer (LGBTIQ+) communities and highlight their harmful impact.

This project is heavily inspired by the [Micropedia](https://www.themicropedia.org/), the first encyclopedia of microagressions.

# How It's Made
**Tech used**: EJS, JavaScript, Node, Express, MongoDB, Mongoose, Tailwind, CSS, HTML

Full-stack app built with EJS and Tailwind on front-end. The main feature is that the users can read, edit and add new microagressions, and read from a few static files which are intended for educational purposes. 

# Optimizations / Future plans

- Fix responsiveness issues based on users feedback
- Add OAuth so that only registered users can edit content
- Re-write the whole app with React components to promote reusability and better design patterns

# Lessons learned
I learned a lot about the tradeoffs of using EJS over React components. ðŸŒš This was also my first project styled with Tailwind, so I learned a lot about Tailwind classes and routing
